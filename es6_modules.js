// A JavaScript module bundler is a tool with a build step (which has access to the file system) to create a final output that is browser-compatible
// webpack is the bundler tool of choice for front-end developers

// npm (node package manager) is a command-line tool that gives you access to plugins, libraries, and tools

// src is the directory where you write all the code that webpack will bundle up
// when webpack runs, it goes through all our files looking for any import statements then compiles all the code needed to run your site into a single file inside of the dist directory
// the entry file is the main application file that links to all other modules in a project (/src/index.js)
// the output file is the compiled version (dist/main.js)

// There are only 2 components to the ES6 module syntax: import and export
// By using ES6 modules, you can keep different parts of your code cleanly separated, which makes writing and maintaining your code much easier and less error-prone
